Fudgy Brownies
Yields: Approximately 16-24 brownies
Prep time: About 10 minutes
Bake time: 25-30 minutes

Ingredients:
    1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
    1 cup granulated sugar
    1 cup packed light brown sugar
    4 large eggs
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/2 teaspoon baking soda
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1 cup organic all-purpose flour
    1 cup chocolate chips (optional)

Instructions:

- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.

- In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in the granulated sugar and brown sugar until well combined.   

- Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.

- In a separate bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.   

- Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.   

- Stir in the chocolate chips, if using.   

- Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread evenly.

- Bake for 22-26 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached. Don't overbake for fudgy brownies.   

- Let cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.

Enjoy your fudgy brownies!
