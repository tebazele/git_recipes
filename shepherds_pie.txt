Classic Shepherd's Pie
This recipe uses ground lamb, which is traditional for shepherd's pie. If you prefer beef, you'll be making cottage pie, but the method is the same!   

Yields: 6-8 servings
Prep time: 30 minutes
Cook time: 1 hour

Ingredients:

For the lamb filling:
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    1 large onion, chopped
    2 carrots, peeled and diced
    2 celery stalks, diced (optional, but adds great flavor)
    2 cloves garlic, minced   
    1.5 lbs ground lamb
    1 teaspoon dried rosemary   
    1 teaspoon dried thyme
    1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
    2 tablespoons tomato paste
    1 cup beef or lamb broth
    1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
    1 cup frozen peas
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

For the mashed potato topping:
    2 lbs russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
    1/2 cup milk (or half-and-half for extra creaminess)
    4 tablespoons unsalted butter
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    Optional: 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese for topping

Equipment:
    Large pot
    Large skillet or Dutch oven
    Potato masher
    9x13 inch baking dish

Instructions:

1. Prepare the mashed potatoes:

    Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in the large pot. Cover them with cold water and add a teaspoon of salt.
    Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes.
    Drain the potatoes well and return them to the pot.   
    Add the milk and butter. Mash until smooth and creamy. Season generously with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.

2. Make the lamb filling:

    While the potatoes are cooking, heat the olive oil in the large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery (if using). Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.
    Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.   
    Add the ground lamb and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it's browned. Drain off any excess fat.
    Stir in the rosemary and thyme. Sprinkle the flour over the lamb and vegetables and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
    Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute, stirring.
    Pour in the beef or lamb broth and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
    Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.
    Stir in the frozen peas and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they are heated through. Season the filling with salt and pepper to taste.

3. Assemble and bake the Shepherd's Pie:

    Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
    Pour the lamb filling into the bottom of the 9x13 inch baking dish, spreading it out evenly.
    Spoon the mashed potatoes over the lamb filling, starting around the edges to create a seal. Spread the potatoes evenly over the top.
    Optional: If desired, sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese over the mashed potatoes.
    Use a fork to rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes. This helps create crispy peaks as it bakes.
    Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
    Let the Shepherd's Pie rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows it to set slightly and makes it easier to serve.

Enjoy your comforting and delicious Shepherd's Pie!
