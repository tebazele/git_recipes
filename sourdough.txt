Basic Sourdough Bread
    Yields: 1 loaf
    Prep time: 30 minutes (active), plus several hours/overnight for fermentation
    Cook time: 45-60 minutes

Ingredients:
    100g (about ½ cup) active and bubbly sourdough starter (fed 4-12 hours before using)
    300g (1 ¼ cups) warm water (around 90-95°F or 32-35°C)
    500g (about 4 cups) bread flour (you can also use a mix of bread flour and a little whole wheat for more flavor)
    10g (about 2 teaspoons) fine sea salt

Equipment:
    Large mixing bowl
    Digital kitchen scale (highly recommended for accuracy)
    Bench scraper
    Proofing basket (banneton) or a bowl lined with a floured kitchen towel
    Dutch oven or baking stone with a steam source (like a tray for water)
    Sharp knife or bread lame

Instructions:

1. Mix the Dough (Autolyse - Optional but Recommended):

    In your large mixing bowl, combine the flour and the warm water. Mix with your hands or a spatula until just a shaggy mass forms. There should be no dry flour left.
    Cover the bowl and let it rest for 30-60 minutes. This process, called autolyse, allows the flour to fully hydrate and helps with gluten development.

2. Add Starter and Salt:

    After the autolyse (or if skipping, directly in the bowl), add the active sourdough starter to the dough. Gently mix it in with your hands until it's mostly incorporated.
    Sprinkle the salt over the dough and add the reserved 15g of water (if you set some aside). Mix again thoroughly until the salt is fully dissolved and the dough feels more cohesive. This might take a few minutes of squeezing and folding the dough.

3. Bulk Fermentation (First Rise):

    Cover the bowl with a lid or damp cloth.
    Let the dough rise at room temperature for 3-6 hours, or even longer depending on the temperature of your kitchen and the activity of your starter. During this time, you'll perform a series of "stretch and folds" to build strength in the dough.
    Stretch and Fold: With wet hands, grab a portion of the dough, gently stretch it upwards, and fold it over the center. Rotate the bowl and repeat this 4-6 times until you've worked your way around the dough.
    Perform a set of stretch and folds every 30-60 minutes for the first 2-3 hours of bulk fermentation. The dough will become smoother and more elastic with each set.
    The dough is ready for the next step when it has increased in volume by about 30-50%, looks bubbly, and feels jiggly.

4. Pre-Shape:

    Gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface using your bench scraper.
    Shape the dough into a loose round or oblong. Be careful not to deflate it too much.
    Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let it rest (bench rest) for 20-30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax, making the final shaping easier.

5. Final Shape:

    Lightly flour your proofing basket (banneton) generously with rice flour (this helps prevent sticking). If you don't have a banneton, line a bowl with a clean kitchen towel and dust it generously with flour.
    Gently shape the dough into its final shape (round or oblong), creating surface tension.
    Place the shaped dough into the proofing basket, seam-side up.
    Cover the basket tightly with plastic wrap or a reusable airtight bag.

6. Cold Proof (Second Rise):

    Refrigerate the covered proofing basket for at least 12 hours, and up to 24-48 hours. This slow, cold fermentation develops more complex flavors.

7. Preheat Oven:

    About 30-60 minutes before you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450-500°F (230-260°C) with your Dutch oven inside (if using) or with a baking stone and a tray for steam. Heating the Dutch oven or baking stone beforehand ensures a hot and even baking environment.

8. Score the Dough:

    Carefully remove the proofing basket from the refrigerator.
    Gently invert the dough onto a piece of parchment paper.
    Using a sharp knife or bread lame, make one or several slashes on the top surface of the dough. This controls where the bread expands during baking.

9. Bake:

    Using a Dutch Oven: Carefully transfer the parchment paper with the dough into the preheated Dutch oven. Cover with the lid.
    Bake for 20 minutes with the lid on. The steam trapped inside helps create a crisp crust and allows for good oven spring.
    Remove the lid and continue baking for another 25-40 minutes, or until the crust is deeply golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 200-210°F (93-99°C).
    Using a Baking Stone: Carefully slide the parchment paper with the dough onto the preheated baking stone. If you're using a steam method, pour about ½ cup of hot water into the preheated steam tray and quickly close the oven door.
    Bake for 20 minutes with steam.
    Remove the steam source and continue baking for another 25-40 minutes, or until the crust is deeply golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 200-210°F (93-99°C).
10. Cool:
    Carefully transfer the baked loaf to a wire rack and let it cool completely before slicing and enjoying (at least 1-2 hours). This allows the internal structure to set.

Important Notes:
    Sourdough Starter: A healthy and active starter is crucial for a good rise and flavor. If you don't have one, you'll need to make one, which takes about a week.
    Flour: Bread flour has a higher protein content, which develops more gluten and results in a chewier texture and better rise. All-purpose flour can be used, but the results might be slightly different.
    Water Temperature: Warm water helps to activate the starter.
    Room Temperature: The warmer your kitchen, the faster the fermentation process will be. Adjust timing accordingly.
    Observation is Key: Pay attention to how your dough looks and feels throughout the process rather than strictly following timings.
    Baking Time: Oven temperatures can vary. Adjust baking time as needed to achieve a deeply golden crust.

Enjoy the journey of baking your own sourdough! It's a process that gets easier and more intuitive with practice.
