Okay, here's a classic chocolate chip cookie recipe for you:

Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies
This recipe typically yields about 24-36 cookies, depending on the size you make them.

Ingredients:

  3/4cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
  3/4 cup granulated sugar
  3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  2 large eggs
  2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
  1 teaspoon baking soda
  1 teaspoon salt
  2 cups (12 ounces) semi-sweet chocolate chips (or your favorite kind)   
  1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
  1) Combine dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
  2) Cream butter and sugars: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until creamy. This usually takes 2-3 minutes.   
  3) Add wet ingredients: Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
  4) Gradually add dry ingredients: Gradually beat the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
  5) Stir in chocolate chips and nuts (if using): Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
  6) Drop onto baking sheets: Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie.
  7) Bake for 9-11 minutes: Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers still look slightly soft. Don't overbake!
  8) Cool slightly: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a couple of minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.gg
